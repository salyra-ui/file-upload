# Backend integrations

The browser framework does not determine the server language. Every integration implements `salyra-upload/1` and exposes its engine separately from HTTP routing. Importing an engine does not start a server.

The programs named `example` bind to localhost by default. They demonstrate the protocol. Mount the handlers in your own server to provide authentication, TLS, request deadlines and application routing. The C socket program is a bounded local test server, not an HTTP framework.

## Session state and storage

A session store holds the descriptor, expiration, confirmed parts and result. A storage adapter receives the body as a stream, keeps temporary parts, inspects its real checkpoint, finalizes the ordered manifest and aborts temporary data.

The native implementations include filesystem storage. S3 and R2 provider adapters are supplied in the Node package. Other engines accept custom storage implementations through their interfaces or callbacks. Installing a native backend does not include an S3 SDK or claim native S3 support.

Use storage outside the web root. The original filename is metadata, never a storage path. The filesystem adapters use generated identifiers and publish through a temporary file on the same filesystem. Hashes and sizes are checked before final publication.

Filesystem coordination has an explicit deployment boundary. Go, Rust, Python, PHP, Ruby, JVM, .NET and C use host operating-system locks. Node uses local process leases. Elixir uses `:global` locks across connected BEAM nodes. Multiple unrelated hosts or disconnected BEAM clusters require a transactional database session store rather than a shared filesystem directory. Python's included filesystem lock and the C filesystem implementation target Unix.

## Own routes and request context

Call the engine's create, probe, part, finish and cancel operations from your own controllers. Router adapters accept their route matcher or dispatch operation. Pass authenticated request context to `scope`, `authorize` and validation hooks. Match the client transport's routes to the chosen paths.

Creation uses a stable idempotency key scoped to the application/user. Access to an existing session is still authorized on every operation. A completed-file list and deletion route belong to the application's catalog, not the temporary-session engine.

Notification IDs are stable per session and event, including the part number for part events. Notifications occur after the relevant storage commit. A reliable business workflow should write to an application outbox with these IDs. A callback alone is not a durable delivery guarantee.

## Compatibility checks

Run each example on its chosen port, then run the shared HTTP checks from the repository root:

```sh
node --import tsx scripts/compatibility.ts http://127.0.0.1:4335/uploads
```

The shared checks exercise duplicate creation, conflicting descriptors, out-of-order chunks, incomplete manifests, duplicate parts, changed content, checkpoint reconciliation, repeated completion and cancel protection. Node fault tests additionally cover lost acknowledgments and ledger gaps. C/C++ tests run under AddressSanitizer and UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.

The implementation contract and storage-specific limits are in [the protocol guide](../protocol/README.md). Package names and artifacts are defined in each integration's manifest. Registry publishing remains a separate release operation.
